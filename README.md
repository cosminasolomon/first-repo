# Cosmina Solomon

#### _Junior Web Developper (...loading)_

> Hi! I am Cosmina, and I currently try to wrap my head around web dev.
> I previously studied and worked in tourism but now that's out the window. I was born in Romania but I consider myself a citizen of the world as I discovered the beauty of living in many different countries. I speak five languages, some better than the others. I prefer dogs not cats, because they taste better...kidding! I am a vegetarian.

## "Skilly" Skills

- I am quite good with _kayaks_, but surpisingly I don't know how to swim;
- _Knitting_ superpowers, with the same pattern;
- I can quote almost every line from _"Friends"_.
